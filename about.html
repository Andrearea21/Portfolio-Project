<p class="about-text">
  I started coding in 2021 while on maternity leave. Due to the covid-crisis I had lost my old position before my leave and I needed something to fight off boredom. I started to learn HTML, CSS and JS just to keep my mind fresh, took my first, short online courses, and got hooked. When I started having more time, I took longer online courses, also learning, e.g. about GitHub, Bootstrap, JQuery and other developer tools. I also completed an intensive course exploring C#, ASP.NET MVC 5 and MVC Core, including SQL server management and migration. 
</p>
<p class="about-text">
  I want to work as a developer, because I fell in love with writing code. I love how I build something when I code. To me it is like being a carpenter who builds amazing things just from wood and their skill. In the same way I want to build things which are useful, yet aesthetic. I want to make my passion into my carrier, but much as a carpenter needs to learn to use their tools, I need real life practice! 
</p>
<p class="about-text">
  My formal education is not in IT, but as a linguist I am apt at writing, and need to be extremely detail oriented, while always envisioning the big picture. I studied communications, because just as with coding I enjoy writing, producing, building and spending hours on getting that one detail just right. Code however, has so much more of a real-life impact. As a MSc of the social science, I can use analytical methodology to, for example, conduct user research. Furthermore, in previous jobs I was always been drawn to taking on additional and more technical roles than those that were in my job description and I want to continue that way.
